# Marble programming language

Marble is a programming language that takes inspiration from C# and Kotlin. It is a statically typed language that
compiles to CIL bytecode. It is designed to be a general purpose language that can be used with the .NET ecosystem.
This organization primarily contains the [compiler](https://github.com/marblelang/marble) and the
[specification](https://github.com/marblelang/marble-spec) for the language. The compiler is written in C# and follows
the specification. The specification is written in Markdown and is a work in progress. The specification is not yet
complete, but it is being actively developed. Contributions are welcome.
